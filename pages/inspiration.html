<h1 style="text-align: center;">some of my inspirations</h1>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>
    <p>Nathan Fielder</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I love Nathan Fielder! I love Nathan for You, On Your Side, and his
      YouTube stuff. I was definitely inspired by how he utilizes random people
      from Craigslist. I also think he's super hot.&nbsp;
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Oh No, Ross and Carrie</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Oh No, Ross and Carrie is a podcast that I really enjoy. It's gotten me
      into learning about some alternative medicines and fringe spiritual
      groups. I love looking online at alternative medicine websites, like
      watersmacker.com.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">I also love the hosts so much!</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Megan Stalter</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Megan Stalter is a comedian on Instagram and Twitter. I love her soo much.
      I think she's so silly and funny without appropriation or
      mean-spiritedness. Hubol showed her to me, and I've loved keeping up with
      her since.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Eric Andre</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Hubol showed me Eric Andre a long time ago. I love his pranks so much.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p><a href="http://www.hubolhubolhubol.com/">Hubol</a></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      Hubol is my brother, so that's pretty awesome. He makes really cool art,
      and he's super encouraging about my art. I love his range, like some of
      his art is so raw and other stuff is more polished. <3
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>On Cinema at the Cinema</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I love the silliness of this show! Hubol introduced me to this show, and
      it's super comforting to me. I love
      <a
        href="https://www.adultswim.com/videos/on-cinema-at-the-cinema/the-trial-day-1"
        >the trial</a
      >, and I think that's the best place to start.&nbsp;
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Patti Harrison</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I think Patti Harrison is so funny. She's so cool. There used to be some
      series on Youtube that she did for SeriouslyTV, but the channel was
      deleted, and now there are some still remaining on their YouTube page. I
      think I first found her googling "trans comedians" and watched all her
      stuff. It was so cool to see her in Shrill.

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I learned about this piece in an art class, and I fell in love with it.
      The misinterpretations and interactive elements were super inspiring. I
      loved reading one of the creator's notes about the piece, like how the
      museum curators were horrified when they saw that people believed it. If
      you haven't read about this piece, I'd definitely recommend learning about
      it!
      <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1146361">This writing</a>
      on the performance is amazing, but I think you need access via a
      university or something like that to read it. If you'd like to read it
      feel free to send me an email.

  <div>
    <p>Dr. Gameshow</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      This podcast is so sweet and silly. I love that Manolo is so terrible at
      all his responsibilities. I love it when people mess up the game rules, or
      when the kids say stuff that's like whattttt.

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I learned about this piece in that same art class. I love to think about
      what the person who received it does after, like if they put it somewhere
      or throw it away.&nbsp;
