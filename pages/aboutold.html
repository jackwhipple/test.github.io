        Hey! I'm Elijah (he/him). My main goal in life is to have fun, which
        sounds cheesy, but it's true! I like to dance, talk, sing, make music,
        day dream, and make art. I also have lots of issues, but mostly they are
        in my brain. I really like skills-based self help worksheets. This is a
        really awesome paragraph. I am 20 years old, and I am majoring in plant
        biology.

        I play ukulele and piano. I also use FL Studio to make some of my music.

        I like using programming in my art because it gives you so much control!
        I know python, but I use javascript for my personal projects with
        libraries like P5js and Pixi.

        I really like making things from scratch with accessible materials, like
        flour. Recently, I have enjoyed drawing on my phone with my finger. I
        also like the idea of drawing things on paper and making them into
        something digital.
      </p>

      <p>
        I really like silly art and projects, like the idea of sloppily making
        things up that don't make sense or confuse people. I also find
        vulnerable stuff really fulfilling to make. Whatever the vibe, I love
        hearing people's responses to my art.
